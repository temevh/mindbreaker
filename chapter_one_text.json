  "intro": "CHAPTER ONE: THE SIGNAL",
  "backstory_1": "The only thing you can remember from last night is the music that was too loud and the time that was too late. \n\nYou knew it was a mistake to go, but what the hell! You only live once! Might as well have some fun while you are at it... \n\n",
  "backstory_2": "The headache is a bitch but there are bigger things to worry about now. After looking around for a bit you realize that the only thing familiar about this place is you.\n\n ",
  "backstory_3": "The only things in the room are you, an annoying flickering light in the ceiling and two doors on one of the walls of the room.\n\nAs you start to get up from the cold concrete floor, you feel something in your pocket...",
  "getUp": "You get up from the floor and stretch your legs. Everything feels a bit off but you can't put your finger on anything specific.\n\nYou approach the two doors.",
  "twoDoors": "The doors have crudely drawn symbols on them.\nThe left one has a drawing of a flower on it.\nThe right one seems to have a skull drawn on it.",
  "doorTouched": "As soon as you touch the doorknob you feel a horrible sting and your vision goes black",
  "numbersCorrect" : "You regain your vision and feel oddly light. Your headache also seems to have eased.",
  "numbersIncorrect" : "You regain your vision but everything feels a bit foggy. Your headache is still crushing your brain from all sides.",
  "doorOpened" : "The door looked heavier than it actually was, causing you to push it a bit too hard and you end up stumbling through it.\n\nThe door closes behind you, making a clicking sound, presumably from the lock doing its job and getting locked.\n\nLike the room on the other side of the now locked door, this one does not look familiar either...",
  "firstEncounterPrompt": "Maybe you should go and talk to them, they could have some useful information. That is assuming they speak the same language..."
